### Light, One-Handed Weapons:

- Crowbar:
  - Pros: Versatile tool for prying and bludgeoning. Effective against single zombies.
  - Cons: Short reach limits effectiveness against multiple enemies. Can be tiring to swing repeatedly.

- Hatchet:
  - Pros: Lightweight and easy to carry. Useful for chopping, prying, and crafting.
  - Cons: Limited damage against stronger zombies. Requires good aim for precise hits.

- Machete:
  - Pros: Excellent for clearing a path through vegetation and dispatching single foes. Wide swings offer good crowd control.
  - Cons: Ineffective in tight spaces. Prone to breaking on bones or thick skulls.

- Knife:
  - Pros: Silent weapon for stealthy takedowns and quick attacks. Can be easily concealed.
  - Cons: Very risky in open combat. Requires precise strikes for effective damage.

- Pry Bar:
  - Pros: Flatter prying end compared to a crowbar, making it more efficient for levering objects open. Can also deliver forceful blows.
  - Cons: Less versatile than a crowbar for prying tasks. Shorter curved design can be awkward for swinging compared to a crowbar.

- Club: 
  - A simple wooden club fashioned from a tree branch or furniture leg.
  - Pros: Easy to craft from readily available materials. Can be effective in a pinch as a last resort weapon.
  - Cons: Lacks durability and reach, making it a poor choice for sustained combat. Offers minimal defense against stronger zombies.

- Sharpened Glass Shard: 
  - Desperate times call for desperate measures. A shard of broken glass taped to a sturdy handle can be surprisingly effective for short-range attacks.
  - Pros: Can be crafted from readily available materials in an emergency situation. Offers potential for quick surprise attacks.
  - Cons: Extremely risky due to the potential for shattering in your hand or getting lodged in the zombie (and then you). Very short reach limits its usefulness.

### Two-Handed Weapons:

- Baseball Bat:
  - Pros: Common and readily available. Can deliver powerful blows with good swing momentum.
  - Cons: Brittle and prone to breaking on impact. Limited effectiveness against multiple enemies.

- Two-Handed Axe:
  - Pros: Powerful weapon capable of cleaving through multiple zombies. Great for breaking down obstacles.
  - Cons: Heavy and requires significant strength to wield effectively. Slow swing speed leaves you vulnerable.

- Shovel:
  - Pros: Multifunctional tool for digging, bludgeoning, and scraping. Sturdy and readily available.
  - Cons: Short reach limits its effectiveness in open combat. Awkward to swing and requires precise timing.

- Makeshift Spear (Or Rebar Spear):
  - Pros: Excellent for keeping enemies at bay. Offers good reach and penetrating attacks.
  - Cons: Can be fragile if made of wood. Requires space to manoeuvre and thrust effectively.

### Heavy Weapons:

- Fire Axe:
  - Pros: Devastating weapon capable of crushing skulls and bones. Great for breaching barricades.
  - Cons: Extremely heavy and requires immense strength to swing. Slow and cumbersome, leaving you vulnerable.

- Sledgehammer:
  - Pros: Can one-hit kill most zombies with a well-placed blow. Effective against heavily armoured undead.
  - Cons: Incredibly heavy and limits movement. Loud clanging sound attracts unwanted attention.

- Chainsaw (Gasoline Powered):
  - Pros: Devastating weapon for close-quarters combat, capable of dismembering multiple zombies with a single swing.
  - Cons: Incredibly loud and attracts large hordes of zombies. 
  - Requires constant fuel maintenance, making it unreliable in the long term. High risk of user getting entangled in the blade during combat.

- Chainsaw (Electric, Corded):
  - Pros: Less powerful than its gasoline counterpart, but quieter and potentially usable for longer periods if a generator is available.
  - Cons: Requires a working generator and extension cord, limiting its use in most situations. High risk of user getting entangled in the blade during combat. Less effective against multiple enemies compared to the gas-powered version.
