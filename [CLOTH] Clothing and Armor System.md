### Environmental Effects

##### Weather Impact:

- Rain:
  - Increases clothing weight, reducing mobility.
  - Reduces insulation, making characters colder and more susceptible to hypothermia.
  - Affects visibility and stealth by dampening sounds of movement.

- Heat:
  - Causes overheating and increases fatigue, reducing stamina.
  - Forces players to prioritize lightweight, breathable clothing.

- Cold:
  - Requires layering with thermal or insulated clothing.
  - Prolonged exposure without proper gear can lead to frostbite or hypothermia.

- Wind:
  - Amplifies the effects of cold and rain.
  - Impacts projectile accuracy and travel distance.

- Acid Rain:
  - Corrodes and damages clothing and armor, requiring frequent repairs or replacements.
  - Certain materials, such as untreated leather and some fabrics, degrade faster under acid rain.
  - Prolonged exposure can cause health issues, necessitating protective gear or seeking shelter quickly.

### Environmental Hazards

- Chemical Spills:
  - Damages or degrades clothing and armor, requiring repairs or replacements.
  - Certain materials offer better resistance (e.g., treated leather, synthetic fabrics).

- Fire:
  - Burns clothing, reducing protection and durability.
  - Characters must avoid direct exposure or use fire-resistant gear.

### Clothing and Armor Interactions

- Layering and Integration:
  - Clothing items can be layered to provide additional protection or warmth.
  - Armor pieces can be worn over or integrated with certain clothing items, affecting slot availability and mobility.
  - Example: A thick jacket may limit the types of chest armor that can be worn over it.

- Weight and Movement:
  - Armor weight directly affects movement speed and stamina.
  - Heavier armor offers more protection but reduces agility and increases fatigue.
  - Lightweight clothing improves mobility but offers less protection.

- Quality and Repair:
  - Armor and clothing condition degrades over time and use, requiring regular maintenance.
  - Cracks, dents, and tears affect durability and protection, necessitating resource allocation for repairs.
  - Armor Penetration and Effectiveness:
  - Different armor types offer varying levels of protection against specific weapon types.
  - Example: Plate armor is effective against slashing attacks but vulnerable to blunt force.

### Social and Psychological Effects

- Status and Cultural Variations:
  - Clothing and armor styles reflect social status and cultural backgrounds.
  - High-quality or rare items indicate higher social standing or affiliations with certain groups.

- Visual Damage and Morale:
  - Visible wear and tear, such as dirt, blood, and tears, impacts character morale and intimidation.
  - Clean and well-maintained gear boosts confidence and social standing.

### Gameplay Features

- Crafting and Modification:
  - Players can create or modify clothing and armor using collected materials.
  - Crafting stations or tools are required for complex modifications and repairs.

- Resource Management:
  - Players must manage resources for repairing and maintaining clothing and armor.
  - Scavenging for materials becomes crucial in prolonged survival scenarios.

- Temperature and Comfort Management:
  - Players need to balance protection with comfort, adapting to changing weather conditions.
  - Clothing choices impact stamina, health, and overall performance.
- Stealth and Noise:
  - Certain clothing and armor types affect the noise level of movement.
  - Soft materials like cloth are quieter than metal armor, impacting stealth gameplay.

- Durability and Degradation:
  - Clothing and armor have durability ratings that decrease with use and damage.
  - Items with low durability offer reduced protection and are more prone to failure.
