- Common Weather:

  - Sunshine: Clear skies with good visibility and potentially increased temperatures.

  - Rain: Can range from light drizzle to heavy downpours. Affects visibility, movement (muddy terrain), and might cause flash floods.

  - Snow: Creates snow cover that slows movement, reduces visibility, and potentially blocks certain areas. Can lead to avalanches in mountainous areas.

  - Wind: Light wind might have little impact, while strong winds can affect character movement (pushing/pulling), ranged attacks (accuracy), and potentially create dust storms or whirlwinds.

  - Fog: Reduces visibility significantly, impacting navigation and combat.

  - Acid Rain: Rain with elevated levels of acidity, damaging plant life, some building materials, and potentially affecting water quality.

- Less Common Weather:

  - Thunderstorms: Heavy rain, strong winds, lightning strikes (can damage objects or ignite fires), and thunder (might startle animals or characters).

  - Sandstorms: Reduces visibility severely, limits movement, and can damage exposed objects.

  - Blizzards: Combines heavy snow with strong winds, creating near-zero visibility and extremely difficult movement.

  - Heatwaves: Extends hot temperatures, potentially leading to character dehydration or heatstroke mechanics.

  - Hurricanes/Tropical Storms: Brings strong winds, heavy rain, and storm surges (flooding coastal areas)

- Considerations:

  - Regional Weather: Think about how weather patterns might differ across your game world. Deserts might experience frequent sandstorms, while mountainous areas could have frequent blizzards.

  - Seasonal Effects: Tie weather patterns to your seasons. Winter might see more snow and blizzards, while summer has a higher chance of heatwaves or thunderstorms.

  - Weather Intensity: Allow for varying intensities within each weather type. A light drizzle has a different impact than a torrential downpour.
