### Common Weather:

- Sunshine:
  - Resource Management: Little impact on resource gathering. May increase crop growth in some cases.
  - Environmental Effects: Warmer temperatures can dry out soil, impacting plant life.
  - Strategic Gameplay: Players might need to manage hydration more in hot climates. Consider implementing stamina systems affected by heat.

- Rain:
  - Resource Management: Can benefit crops and water collection. Heavy rain might hinder resource gathering activities.
  - Environmental Effects: Creates muddy terrain, affecting movement speed. Heavy rain can cause floods, blocking paths or creating hazards.
  - Strategic Gameplay: Players might need to adjust travel routes based on flooding. Consider crafting waterproof gear or building shelters.

- Snow:
  - Resource Management: Limits access to certain resources due to snow cover. May impact hunting or gathering activities.
  - Environmental Effects: Reduces visibility and slows movement significantly. Blocks some areas completely.
  - Strategic Gameplay: Requires players to adapt clothing for warmth. Consider implementing mechanics for tracking and avoiding avalanches.

- Wind:
  - Resource Management: Little impact on resource gathering directly. Strong winds can damage crops or structures.
  - Environmental Effects: Strong winds can reduce visibility (blowing dust or snow) and make ranged attacks less accurate.
  - Strategic Gameplay: Players might need to adjust travel routes or seek shelter during strong winds. Consider implementing mechanics for using wind currents for strategic movement (sailing, gliding).

- Fog:
  - Resource Management: Little impact on resource gathering directly.
  - Environmental Effects: Significantly reduces visibility, impacting navigation and combat effectiveness.
  - Strategic Gameplay: Players might need to rely on alternative navigation methods (sound, landmarks) in fog. Consider implementing items or skills that improve visibility in fog.

- Acid Rain:
  - Resource Management: Damages crops and some building materials. Players might need to invest in protective gear or alternative resource gathering methods.
  - Environmental Effects: Contaminates water sources, requiring purification methods. Can harm certain plant and animal life, impacting resource availability.
  - Strategic Gameplay: Players need to plan for the corrosive effects. Consider implementing mechanics for collecting rainwater or finding alternative water sources. Protective gear might be necessary during heavy acid rain.

### Less Common Weather:

- Thunderstorms:
  - Resource Management: Little impact on resource gathering directly. Lightning strikes can damage structures or start fires.
  - Environmental Effects: Heavy rain, strong winds, and lightning strikes pose hazards. Thunder might startle animals.
  - Strategic Gameplay: Players might need to seek shelter during thunderstorms. Consider implementing mechanics for attracting or repelling lightning strikes.

- Sandstorms:
  - Resource Management: Limits resource gathering due to reduced visibility. Can damage exposed equipment.
  - Environmental Effects: Severely reduces visibility and makes movement difficult. Sand can damage equipment or irritate eyes.
  - Strategic Gameplay: Players need to adjust travel routes or seek shelter during sandstorms. Consider implementing items like goggles or sand filters for protection.

- Blizzards:
  - Resource Management: Extremely limited resource gathering possibilities. Hunting and travel become nearly impossible.
  - Environmental Effects: Near-zero visibility and extremely difficult movement due to heavy snow and strong winds.
  - Strategic Gameplay: Players need proper shelter and warmth during blizzards. Consider implementing mechanics for surviving blizzards, like building snow caves or crafting warm clothing.

- Heatwaves:
  - Resource Management: May impact crop growth due to extreme heat. Players might face water shortages.
  - Environmental Effects: Extremely high temperatures can lead to dehydration or heatstroke for players.
  - Strategic Gameplay: Players need to manage hydration carefully during heatwaves. Consider implementing mechanics for finding shade or cooling down, such as consumable items or water sources.

- Hurricanes/Tropical Storms:
  - Resource Management: Can destroy crops and damage structures. Resource gathering becomes difficult or impossible during storms.
  - Environmental Effects: Strong winds, heavy rain, and storm surges cause widespread destruction and flooding.
  - Strategic Gameplay: Players need to evacuate or find sturdy shelter before the storm hits. Consider implementing mechanics for preparing for hurricanes, like building fortifications or securing loose objects.
