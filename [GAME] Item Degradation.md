- Implement a system to track the degradation of items over time and provide notifications when items are nearing the end of their useful life.

- Introduce a feature that allows users to set up automated processes for replacing degraded items in their inventory.

- Create visual indicators within the application to easily identify which items are approaching or have reached their degradation threshold.

- Provide analytics and reporting tools to help users understand patterns of item degradation and make informed decisions about maintenance or replacement schedules.

- Explore machine learning algorithms to predict item degradation based on usage patterns and environmental factors, enabling proactive maintenance strategies.
