- ### Power Scarcity and Management:

  - Scavenge for Power Sources: Players wouldn't build power plants, but rather scavenge for existing power sources like:

  - Abandoned buildings with functioning generators (limited fuel)

  - Hydroelectric dams - Players might need to repair or maintain them.

  - Solar panels on rooftops (limited by daylight and weather)

  - Wind turbines in suitable locations (unreliable without wind)

  - Resource Management is Crucial: Fuel for generators would be a precious resource requiring careful rationing. Players might need to:

  - Ration power usage - Prioritize essential devices like lights or medical equipment.

  - Implement manual alternatives - Use hand-cranked tools or oil lamps during power outages.

  - Explore alternative energy sources - Craft basic windmills or solar collectors for limited power.

  - Power Grid Limitations: Forget complex grids. Players might need to use salvaged electrical components to:

  - Wire power directly from the source to a limited number of nearby structures.

  - Craft makeshift fuses to prevent overloading.

- ### Electrical Hazards and Safety:

  - Improvised Wiring: Using salvaged wires and components carries a high risk of:

  - Short circuits causing fires or equipment damage. Players need to be cautious and prioritize repairs over new connections.

  - Electrocution hazards - Players might need to wear improvised insulation (rubber gloves) when working with live wires.

  - Maintaining Existing Systems: Players might need to find spare parts or improvise repairs to keep existing electrical systems running. Failing to do so could lead to:

  - Blackouts and loss of power for crucial devices.

  - Permanent equipment damage requiring even more resources to fix.

- ### Balancing for Difficulty:

  - Limited Power Consumption: Most electrical devices are out of the question. Focus on low-powered necessities like:

  - Basic lighting systems for nighttime visibility and navigation.

  - Simple medical equipment requiring minimal power.

  - Communication tools (radios) with limited range and high power consumption.

  - Progression through Knowledge: Players might find books or manuals on basic electrical principles:

  - Safely connecting salvaged components.

  - Troubleshooting and repairing existing electrical systems.

  - Crafting basic tools like hand-cranked generators or solar collectors for low-power needs.

- ### Working TV (Luxury Item):

  - Rarity and Difficulty: Finding a fully functional TV is extremely rare. Players might encounter them in:

  - Abandoned military bases or research facilities (potentially heavily guarded).

  - Ruined media centers or TV stations (often heavily damaged or looted).

  - Pre-apocalypse homes (functioning but possibly outdated technology).

  - Condition and Repair: Most TVs will be damaged or require specific parts to function. Players might need to scavenge for:

  - Replacement cathode ray tubes (extremely fragile and rare)

  - Circuit boards or specific electronic components for repairs (limited by technical knowledge)

- ### Powering the TV:

  - Generators: Requires a large amount of fuel, making watching TV a luxury.

  - Solar Panels: Limited by daylight and requires a significant number of panels for a TV's power needs.

  - Bicycle Generator: Players can craft a makeshift generator using a bicycle and salvaged parts, requiring manual effort to generate power for short viewing sessions.

- ### Content and Reception:

  - Limited Content: Players might find:

  - Pre-recorded media on salvaged tapes or discs (limited selection and prone to deterioration)

  - Occasional broadcasts from functioning radio towers (unreliable and potentially dangerous information)

  - Static or scrambled signals requiring technical knowledge to manipulate for reception.

- ### Strategic Considerations:

  - Luxury vs. Necessity: Using a TV consumes precious resources. Players have to decide if it's worth the investment for:

  - Morale boost - Watching pre-recorded media can provide a brief escape from the harsh reality.

  - Information gathering - Capturing occasional broadcasts might provide valuable information (weather patterns, potential threats).

  - Security Risk: TV reception might attract unwanted attention. Players might need to:

  - Set up makeshift antennas in secluded areas.

  - Limit viewing times to minimize the risk of detection.
