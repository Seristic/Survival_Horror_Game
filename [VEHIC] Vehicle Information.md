Classic Survivors (Reliable & Easy to Maintain):



### Salvaged Cars (Sedans/Pickups):

- Common Breakdowns:
  - Flat Tire: Punctures from debris, worn treads, or improper inflation are frequent issues.
  - Dead Battery: Extreme temperatures, electrical malfunctions, or a failing alternator can drain the battery.
  - Clogged Fuel Filter: Dirty fuel or debris buildup restricts fuel flow, causing engine sputtering and power loss.

- Scavenger Fixes:
  - Flat Tire: Patching with cured animal hides or scavenged rubber scraps is a common fix. Finding a replacement tire in good condition is another option.
  - Dead Battery: Jumper cables fashioned from scavenged wires can be used to jump-start from another vehicle with a working battery.
  - Clogged Fuel Filter: Basic mechanical knowledge allows cleaning the filter with rudimentary tools. Replacement filters might be found scavenging settlements or wrecks.
  - Storage: Moderate cargo space in trunk and bed (pickups). Can be significantly increased by towing a trailer (see note below).

- Notes:
  - Salvaged cars offer a good balance of speed, storage, and ease of repair.
  - They are relatively common, making finding parts and replacement components easier.

### Salvaged Motorcycles: (Nimble & Fuel Efficient)

- Common Breakdowns:
  - Flat Tire: Similar to cars, punctures and worn treads are common.
  - Chain Issues: A loose, rusty, or broken chain can render the motorcycle unusable.
  - Spark Plug Problems: Fouled or damaged spark plugs cause ignition issues and difficulty starting.

- Scavenger Fixes:
  - Flat Tire: Patching with scavenged materials is possible. Finding a replacement might be easier due to the smaller tire size.
  - Chain Issues: Adjusting a loose chain is relatively simple. Replacing a broken chain requires a compatible scavenged chain and tools to connect it.
  - Spark Plug Issues: Replacing spark plugs requires compatible ones found scavenging. Cleaning fouled plugs might be possible with limited tools and scavenged cleaning materials.
  - Storage: Limited storage capacity for supplies. Can be improved with saddlebags or small trailers.

Notes:
  - Motorcycles are ideal for navigating tight spaces and off-road terrain.
  - They are fuel-efficient but offer minimal protection from the elements and attacks.

### Heavy Duty Haulers (Strength & Capacity):

Armored Military Truck: (Powerful but Maintenance Hungry)

- Common Breakdowns:
  - Flat Tire: Large tires are less frequent to puncture but require specialized tools to change.
  - Overheating: Clogged radiator due to dust buildup or excessive load on the engine can cause overheating.
  - Fuel Line Issues: Leaks or blockages in the fuel lines can disrupt fuel flow and engine performance.

- Scavenger Fixes (Limited):
  - Flat Tire: Replacing a large military tire is a challenge, but patching a minor puncture might be possible with extensive scavenged materials and tools.
  - Overheating: Cleaning the radiator with scavenged water and tools might alleviate overheating. Reducing load or adding scavenged coolant could be temporary solutions.
  - Fuel Line Issues: Patching minor leaks with scavenged materials might be a temporary fix. Extensive damage or blockages would likely require replacing the fuel line (difficult without parts).
  - Storage: Largest cargo capacity of all mentioned vehicles. Can tow even larger trailers.

 - Notes:
  - Military trucks offer immense hauling capability and some protection.
  - Their size and complexity make them difficult to maintain and require more fuel.

### Unique Scavenger Finds:

Abandoned School Bus: (Spacious but Resource-Draining)

Common Breakdowns:

Multiple Flat Tires: Due to the number of wheels, the chance of encountering a flat tire is higher. (Refer to "Flat Tire" fixes mentioned earlier).

Dead Battery: The large battery required for a bus can be difficult to replace.

Suspension Problems: Overloading the bus can damage the suspension system, impacting handling and ride quality.

Scavenger Fixes (Limited):

Multiple Flat Tires: The larger number of tires increases the time and resources needed for repairs.

Dead Battery: Finding a replacement large battery would be extremely difficult. Jury-rigging a jump start from multiple smaller batteries might be a risky attempt.

Suspension Problems: Reinforcing or replacing suspension parts could be attempted with scavenged metal and tools, but the success would depend on the severity of the damage and the scavenger's skill.

Storage: Massive interior space for storage or conversion into living quarters. Can tow trailers for additional cargo.

Notes:

School buses offer exceptional passenger and cargo capacity, potentially serving as a mobile base.

Their size and weight make them slow, loud, and fuel-hungry.

Workhorse Tractor (Towing & Potential Farming):

Pros: Excellent towing capacity for hauling large trailers or salvaged equipment.

Cons: Limited passenger capacity (usually just the driver), slow speed.

Initial Use: Primarily for towing in the early game.

Later Uses (with Upgrades): Can be used for plowing fields, planting crops, and potentially even limited harvesting with creative modifications.

Breakdowns: While generally reliable, tractors can suffer from engine trouble, flat tires, and issues with belts or attachments.

Scavenger Fixes: Many tractor parts are repairable with basic tools and scavenged metal. Finding replacement tires might be challenging but possible.

Notes: Tractors are invaluable for establishing a sustainable base in the long term. Their versatility makes them a strategic long-term investment.
